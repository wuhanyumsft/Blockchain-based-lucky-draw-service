# Blockchain-based-lucky-draw-service
Lucky draw nowadays is not transparent enough. We need a verifiable process to generate number for lucky draw. [From wiki] By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. Let's combine blockchain and lucky draw and make us winner for next party!

# Features

## Verifiable
Everyone can calculate and get the same result later.

## Random
No one can predict or control the drawn value.

## Fair
All possible values are of equally probable (uniform distribution).

Each number drawn must be statistically independent.
